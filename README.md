# Logic Design Final Exam @ Politecnico di Milano 🚀

## Goal 🎯

The specification of the " Final Exam (Logic Design) " for Academic Year 2022/2023 calls for implementing a HW module (described in VHDL) that interfaces with a memory and complies with the directions given in the following specification. At a high level of abstraction, the system receives indications about a memory location, the contents of which must be routed to one output channel among the four available. The indications about the channel to be used and the memory address to be accessed are provided by means of a one-bit serial input, while the system outputs, i.e., the aforementioned channels, provide all the bits of the memory word in parallel.
